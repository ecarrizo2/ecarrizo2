## Hi! I'm Ezequiel Carrizo ðŸ‘‹.

Originally from Argentina, I now call Tenerife my home, a strategic move to sidestep those pesky timezone headaches for at least half the year! As a lifelong technology enthusiast, my journey into the IT industry began when I was a child, since then my professional path has been around code and creativity, currently acting as Technical Lead at TKWW, where I lead cross-functional teams of talented engineers to deliver high-quality software solutions.

I do enjoy spending time with my family and friends, reading, or solving puzzles.
I am Scuba Diver and I love to travel and explore new places; My dad always say that I did my first dive in 10 inches of water at the age of 3 years old.
I do love car restoration and side projects, the ones I am most proud of:

- [Restoration of a Dodge Coronado 1968, which is my pride and joy](https://ezequielcarrizo.com/projects/dodge-coronado-1968.html)
- Teamed up with my dad to Camperize a Van, which is now my go-to for traveling around

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning something new, have discovered anything intersting? Tell me about it!

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking an Open-Source project to collaborate. Need help? reach me!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Scuba Diving, Car Restoration, Computer Science, Software Development and Good Practices
